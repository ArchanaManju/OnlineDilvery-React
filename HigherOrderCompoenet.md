Takes the compoenet and returns a compoenet.

takes existing comppoenet and returns then improved version of it .

ex:
in our code we will take resturancard and add label like promoted only if we have data to that returant .


const withHighRating =(RestaurantCard) =>{
return ()=>{
    return
(    <div></div>)
    
}
}

withHighRating ==> higherorder compoenet 
takes compoenet (RestaurantCard) as input and return a function or component
()=>{
    return
(    <div></div>)
    
}
